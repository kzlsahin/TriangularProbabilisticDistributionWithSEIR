# Implementation of Triangular Probabilistic Distribution onto Delay Differential Equations on the basis of SEIR model
[published paper ->](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0164226)

Animator for a SEIR model with triangular probabilistic distribution used for reovery transition.

I developed this application as a supportive part of my academic research. This app demonstrates that a triangular probabilistic distribution can be used as a multiple delay on delay differantial equations.
